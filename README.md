## Requirements
1. The experiments output `progress.csv` files that contain the metrics.
2. For each `progress.csv` file to be plotted, it also needs a `params.json` that specifies the parameters of the experiments to be plotted. The two files need to be in the same directory

## Example
Run the python script `plot_util.py`
